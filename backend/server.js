// SECURITY MIDDLEWARE SECTION
// This applies security headers to every request
// It's like putting a security system on your house

// This is like having a bouncer at a club who limits how many people can enter

  credentials: true                 // Allow cookies and authentication headers

// LOGGING MIDDLEWARE - This records all requests to your server
// It's like a security camera that records everything that happens
app.use(morgan('combined')); // 'combined' means log everything in detail

// BODY PARSING MIDDLEWARE - This helps read data sent from the frontend
// It's like having a translator that converts frontend data into something the backend can understand
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));           // Parse JSON data (like form submissions)
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10mb' })); // Parse URL-encoded data
app.use(cookieParser());                            // Parse cookies from requests

// STATIC FILES - This serves uploaded files (like product images)
// It's like creating a public folder where people can access files

// AUTHENTICATION RATE LIMITING - This is stricter rate limiting just for login/registration
// It's like having a special security guard just for the entrance
const authLimiter = rateLimit({

// ERROR HANDLING MIDDLEWARE - This catches any errors that happen in your application
// It's like having a safety net that catches anything that goes wrong
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  // Log the error to the console (for developers to see)
  console.error(err.stack);

  });

// 404 HANDLER - This handles requests to pages that don't exist
// It's like having a "Page Not Found" sign for unknown addresses
app.use('*', (req, res) => {
  // * means "any route that wasn't handled by the routes above"
  res.status(404).json({ error: 'Route not found' }); // Send 404 error
});

// START THE SERVER - This actually starts your web server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
